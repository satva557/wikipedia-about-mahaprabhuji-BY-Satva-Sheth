    <!-- Section 1: Introduction -->
    <section>
   <h2> Who was Vallabhacharya?</h2>
<p>Vallabhacharya was born in 1479 and was a great saint and philosopher of the 16th century. He was the founder of Shuddhadvaita philosophy, a form of Advaita Vedanta. He gave a distinct identity to the Krishna bhakti stream in Vaishnavism and founded Pushtimarg.</p>

    </section>

    <!-- Section 2: Time of Birth -->

    <section>

        <h2>Time of Birth</h2>

        <p>
            Shri Vallabhacharya was born in a time of significant turmoil, not only politically but also religiously. In
            the religious realm, there was confusion and a lack of clarity about the meaning of the sacred scriptures.
            On the political front, the northern and central parts of India were witnessing invasions from Muslim
            forces, which created chaos and fear among the Hindu population. The very survival of Hinduism and its
            traditions was under threat. People were desperately looking for a leader who could help them understand
            their faith better and guide them through such a difficult period. It was at this crucial time that Shri
            Vallabhacharya emerged, offering clarity in religious matters and the courage to carry on in difficult
            circumstances.
        </p>

    </section>

    <!-- Section 3: Birth and Early Life -->

    <section>

        <h2>Birth and Early Life</h2>

        <p>
            The ancestors of Shri Vallabhacharya hailed from Andhra Pradesh and belonged to the Vellanadu (or
            Vellaantiya) clan of Telugu Vaidiki Brahmins, who were followers of the Vishnu Swamy school of thought.
            According to tradition, Lord Krishna had commanded Shri Yagnanarayan Bhattaji, the ancestor of
            Vallabhacharya, that He would be born in their family after they completed 100 Somayagnas (fire sacrifices).
            By the time Shri Lakshmana Bhattaji, a descendant of Shri Yagnanarayan Bhattaji, had moved to Varanasi, the
            family had completed the prescribed 100 Somayagnas. Shri Vallabhacharya was born to Shri Lakshmana Bhattaji
            in Champaran on the 11th day of the dark fortnight of Chaitra month in 1479 AD (Vikram Samvat 1535). His
            mother's name was Ilammagaruji.
        </p>

    </section>

    <!-- Section 4: Divine Birth -->

    <section>
        <h2>Divine Birth</h2>
        <p>
            The birth of Shri Vallabhacharya occurred during a turbulent period when much of northern and central India
            was under the rule of Muslim invaders. The Hindu population was facing religious persecution, and many were
            fleeing to protect their faith. Once, when Shri Lakshmana Bhattaji was in Varanasi, he learned of an
            impending Muslim attack. Concerned for their safety, he and his wife fled Varanasi, but during their
            journey, Shri Illammagaruji delivered her child prematurely, two months ahead of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the child showed no signs of life, the parents were devastated and left the baby under a tree, wrapped
            in cloth. In a dream, Lord Shri Krishna appeared to the parents and revealed that He Himself had incarnated
            as their child. The parents rushed back and found their baby alive, surrounded by a divine circle of fire.
            The mother, unscathed by the fire, took the child in her arms, and he was named Vallabha, which means
            "beloved."
        </p>

    </section>

    <!-- Section 5: Education -->

    <section>

        <h2>Education and Studies</h2>

        <p>
            Shri Vallabhacharya's education began at the age of seven, with the study of the four Vedas. As he grew
            older, he became well-versed in the six systems of Indian philosophy (Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga,
            Mimamsa, and Vedanta). He also studied the works of renowned philosophers such as Shri Shankaracharya, Shri
            Ramanujacharya, Shri Madhvacharya, and Shri Nimbarkacharya, along with Buddhist and Jain philosophies.
            Vallabhacharya was known for his exceptional memory and ability to recite hundreds of mantras, not only
            forwards but also in reverse order.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through his discourses and teachings, Shri Vallabhacharya became a well-known figure, highly regarded as a
            beacon of knowledge and wisdom. He was hailed as Bal Saraswati, a title that reflected his deep
            understanding and mastery of sacred texts.
        </p>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Philosophy and Works</h2>
        <p>
            Shri Vallabhacharya is best known for his doctrine of Shuddhadvaita or Pure Non-dualism, which emphasizes
            that there is no distinction between the individual soul (Atman) and the Supreme (Brahman), and that God is
            formless (Nirakar) yet simultaneously has a personal, divine form (Sakar). His philosophy is distinct from
            other Vedantic schools, particularly those of Shankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, and Madhvacharya. Shri
            Vallabhacharya's teachings focus on absolute devotion (bhakti) to Lord Krishna, with the belief that through
            surrendering to Him, a devotee can achieve ultimate liberation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shri Vallabhacharya also emphasized the importance of Pushti Marg, the path of grace, which involves
            surrendering to the will of Lord Krishna and accepting His divine grace to achieve salvation. This path is
            centered around devotion, love, and complete surrender to God, leading to a life of peace, harmony, and
            spiritual fulfillment.

        <h2>Establishment of Pushti Marga - The Path of Grace
</h2>
        <p>
            When shri Vallabhacharyaji entered Gokul, he thought about the important question of restoring people to the right path of devotion. At that time shri Krishna appeared in front of him and revealed the 'Brahma Sambandha' ("Relation with Brahman, the supreme Godhead") , a mantra of self dedication to shri Krishna. During that time Damodardas Harasaniji was sleeping next to him. In the early morning, shri Vallabha Acharyaji told this experience to his worthiest and most beloved disciple, Damodardasaji and asked him - “Damala! Did you hear any voice last night?’’ Damodaradasji replied that "I heard it, but was not able to understand the meaning of it." Shri Vallabhacharyaji then explained the meaning of the mantra and thus damodardasji became the first Vaishnava initiated by shri Vallabhacharyaji.


        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Shri Mahaprabhuji’s Bethakji</h2>
        <p>Shri Vallabhacharyaji is also known as shri Mahaprabhuji. Apart from Shrimad Bhagvat path (= reading) as a daily routine he also conducted discourse on shrimad Bhagvat at different places. Generally that places are sited as ‘Bethakjis of shri Mahaprabhuji’. As per the ‘84 bethakji charitra granth’ the number of bethakjis on the earth is 84.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Piligrimage of India</h2>
        <p>To spread the message given by Bhagvan shri Krishna; shri Vallabhacharyaji traveled all over India; three times. His bright personality, strength of wisdom and great commitment towards his mission were exceptional. Due to such an impressive stature; many people became his followers. Among them 84 devoted disciples are most famous and their life has been documented in Pushti Marg literature as the ‘Story of 84 Vaishnavas’</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Asura Vyamoh Leela</h2>
        <p>In about 1530 A.D., bhagvan shri Krishna commanded shri Vallabhacharyaji to leave the worldly life and to come near Him. Shri Krishna had previously expressed his wish on two different occasions. The third command was accepted by shri Vallabhacharya as the last verdict. He arrived at Kashi and following the Vedic traditions, formally renounced the world by taking Sanyasa and a vow of silence. He lived in a hut made of leaves on the Hanuman ghat for about a week. He spent his last days in contemplation of shri Krishna and suffered agonies of separation from Him. The members of his family assembled near him for his last darshan. When asked about his advice, shri Vallabhacharyaji scribbled three and a half Sanskrit verses in the sand by way of counsel. This collection of verses is known as ‘ShikshaSloki’. He entered into the waters of the Ganges on the day of Rath Yatra. People witnessed a sparkling flame as it arose from the water and ascended to heaven. This episode is known as AsurVyamohLeela. Even if Shri Vallabh is not visible to every one with the physical eyesight; the followers always feel his eternal existence. He is with us in the form of his granthas and bethakjis and above all in the hearts of his dedicated vaishnavs.</p>
